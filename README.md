# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Genetic Algorithm

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Genetic Algorithm project is designed to find optimal routes for a vehicle to visit a set of locations, including a depot and several customers. This project leverages a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the VRP and visualizes the best route using `matplotlib`.

## Documentation

- [User Manual](https://vrp-genetic-algo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Tutorial](https://github.com/yourusername/vrp-genetic-algo/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md)

## Examples

Here are some examples included in this project:

- [Basic Example](https://github.com/yourusername/vrp-genetic-algo/blob/main/examples/basic_example.py) - A simple implementation of the Genetic Algorithm for solving the VRP with default parameters.
- [Custom Locations](https://github.com/yourusername/vrp-genetic-algo/blob/main/examples/custom_locations.py) - An example demonstrating how to use custom locations and visualize the route.

In addition to these, further examples can be found in the [test suite](https://github.com/yourusername/vrp-genetic-algo/tree/main/tests) and the corresponding output of the Genetic Algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/yourusername/vrp-genetic-algo/tree/main/output).
